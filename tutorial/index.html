  <h1>How to Contribute to the Logging Roads Initiative</h1>

  <p>All logging road data are stored in OpenStreetMap, a global dataset of geographic data fully managed by crowd-based edits.</p>

  <p>The Fix Logging Roads tool updates data in OpenStreetMap based on your responses. Anyone can participate, no previous mapping experience is required. You will need to sign up for an OpenStreetMap account using your email address. Instructions are below.</p>

  <p>If you are familiar with OpenStreetMap, we also need help mapping roads. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/osm">Click Here</a> for more information. Also see the OSM <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/guide">Mapping Guide</a></p>


  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>Requirements: Web browser + internet connection - We recommend using either the Chrome or Firefox web browsers for this task.</p>

    <p>Go to <a href="http://loggingroads.org" target="_blank">http://loggingroads.org</a>, click "Start Contributing", then click on a task, for example "Tag Logging Road Creation Dates". As the project progresses additional tasks may be listed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/PreviewTask.png" alt="Selecting a Task - Screenshot"/>
    <p>This will take you to the http://fix.loggingroads.org tool. This tool shows one task at a time and asks you to select the correct answer. You can preview the tasks, however to participate you will need to Login.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Login / Sign Up for an OpenStreetMap Account</h1>
  <div class="clearfix">

    <p>Click the "Get Started" button.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">

    <p>A login form for OpenStreetMap will popup. (If you don't see the form you may need to allow popups)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/OSMRegister.png" alt="Sign Up for OSM - Screenshot"/>
    <p>If you don't have an account, click "register now". This will display a sign up form and then ask you to confirm your email.

  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/OSMAuthorize.png" alt="Grant Access to OSM - Screenshot"/>
    <p>After logging in, OpenStreetMap will ask you to authorize the Logging Roads application to use your account.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Identify the Year a Road is Created</h1>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/ViewTask.png" alt="Viewing Task - Screenshot"/>
    <p>After you login you will be shown a task. The pink road line identifies the road line for the task. We need to find the first year where the pink road line is visible in the imagery.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/ShowRoads.png" alt="Show Roads Checkbox - Screenshot"/>
    <p>To make it easier to see the imagery, try turning the road lines on/off using the "Show Roads" checkbox.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/MoreYears.png" alt="More Years Button - Screenshot"/>
    <p>Use the "More Years" button view more additional years. We currently have imagery for 2000 through 2014.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Selecting the Year</h1>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/SkipTask.png" alt="Skipping a Task - Screenshot"/>
    <p>Many of the roads are extremely difficult (or impossible) to identify with the current imagery. If that is the case, please click "Skip/Too Difficult". Only select a year if the road is obviously identifiable in the imagery.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/SelectYear.png" alt=" - Screenshot"/>
    <p>If you are able to see the year the road is created, click "Select" on that year.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/screenshots/ConfirmChangeToOSM.png" alt="Confirm Change to OpenStreetMap - Screenshot"/>
    <p>You will be asked to confirm the edit being made to OpenStreetMap. Click "Save to OSM" to submit. The site will automatically show you the next task.</p>
