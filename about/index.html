# The Initiative

Often overlooked as indicators of large-scale forest loss, the logging roads that cross our planet’s rainforest represent the seeds of unchecked deforestation. Proper monitoring of these roads is crucial if we hope to improve environmental governance of rainforest resources. However, these roads’ often remote location and sporadic usage presents a challenge to those hoping to map their spread.

To increase transparency of rainforest logging activities, the [World Resources Institute](http://wri.org) and [Moabi](http://rdc.moabi.org) are launching the Logging Roads Initiative. Our aim is to provide an open data portal to track the spread of logging roads across the Congo Basin region of Central Africa. Using thirteen  years of satellite imagery, the project will record the precise spread of logging roads over time. 

With tools developed by [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team ([HOT](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/)), the initiative invites anyone with a passion for preserving our planet’s forests to add, edit, and improve the geographic data  that currently exist for the region. Once compiled, this data will be free to the public, encouraging a greater awareness of the impact of logging activities on the region.
