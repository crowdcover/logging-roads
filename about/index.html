 Often overlooked as indicators of large-scale forest loss, the logging roads that crosstraverse our planet’s rainforest represent the seeds of unchecked deforestation. Proper monitoring of these roads is crucial if we hope to improve environmental governance of rainforest resourcesgauge forest loss due to logging. However, these roads’ often remote location and sporadic usage presents a challenge to those hoping to map their spread.

 To increase transparency of rainforest logging activitiesTo this end, the [World Resources Institute]() and Moabi are launching thehave partnered to form the Logging Roads Initiative. Our aim is to provide an open data portal to track the spread of logging roadshelp monitor geographic data on logging roads across the Congo Basin region of Central Africa, the world’s second-largest rainforest. Using thirteen fifteen years of satellite imagery, the project will record the precise spread of logging roads over time. 

 With Using tools developed by OpenStreetMap and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT)platform, the Logging Roads iInitiative invites anyone with a passion for preserving our planet’s forestsforested land to add, edit, and improve the logging road datamaps that currently exist for the region. Once compiled, this data will be free to the public, encouraging a greater awareness of the impact of logging activities these logging roads are having on the region.
