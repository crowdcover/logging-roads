      Logging roads are a major indicator of deforestation in the Congo Basin . Until now, their reach has been difficult to visualize, obscuring the rapid rise in deforestation in the region. Often, these roads are discovered only after they have been abandoned.

      Together, the [World Resources Institute](http://wri.org) and [Moabi](http://rdc.moabi.org) are analyzing over a decade of imagery to track rainforest logging road activity.

      But we can’t do it alone.  The Logging Roads Initiative serves as a call to action for those passionate about preserving these diverse and important landscapes. Through crowdsourcing we can drastically improve the oversight of environmental activity.

      Sounds good?  Let’s get started.
