      Logging roads are a major indicator of deforestation in the Congo Basin . Until now, their reach has been difficult to visualize, obscuring the rapid rise in deforestation in the region. Often, these roads are discovered only after they have been abandoned.

      Together, [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) and [Moabi](http://www.moabi.org) are analyzing over a decade of imagery to track rainforest logging road activity.

      But we can’t do it alone.  The Logging Roads Initiative serves as a call to action for those passionate about preserving these diverse and important landscapes. Through crowdsourcing we can drastically improve the oversight of environmental activity.

      Sounds good?  Let’s get started.
