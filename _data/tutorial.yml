      Logging roads are a major indicator of deforestation in the Congo Basin . Until now, their reach has been difficult to visualize, obscuring the rapid rise in deforestation in the region. Often, these roads are discovered only after they have been abandoned.

      The Logging Roads project is a joint initiative of [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) and [Moabi](http://www.moabi.org) to monitor the spread of logging roads across the Congo Basin.

      Together, we are analyzing over a decade of imagery to track rainforest logging road activity.

      But we can’t do it alone. The project relies on contributions from individual volunteers to interpret satellite imagery and track the growth of logging activity.

      The Logging Roads Initiative serves as a call to action for those passionate about preserving these diverse and important landscapes. Through crowdsourcing we can drastically improve the oversight of environmental activity.

      Sounds good?  Let’s get started.
